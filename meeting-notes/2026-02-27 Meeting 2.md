## Discussion

### Meeting time
- Moving from 10:30-11 AM on Friday in the future
- Except if we need more time
- Feel free to reach out at any time

### Resources
- Colab resources from MIT instead of BMW (easier)
- Except if we want to train a model: we can give a script / docker to BMW

### What we did
- Litterature review
  - GEPA
  - Trace
  - Maybe combine both?

### By March 7: Litterature review
- We need to have a document they can refer to, where we put our litterature review

### Data: split by RO subcategories?
- We could, it is one approach to train independently
- But there are some similarities between some subcategories

### Data: generator
- No synthetic generator yet, but Jason will share a ground truth for the existing data

### Evaluator
- Jason will hsare a script to score the synthetic output VS ground truth (JSON)
- We can also have our own evaluator, but this will be the one they will use

### Final thoughts
- The goal of the project is a POC
- But if we find anything interesting, we can publish a paper
